<p>Welcome to my blog. My name is MaÃ«l and Iâ€™m a Data Scientist and  Ph.D. student at Idiap research institute (EPFL) in Speech Processing, on <a href="https://roxanne-euproject.org/">ROXANNE European Project</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of Data Science, my interests are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traveling: I have been traveling to South East Asia, New Zealand, Tahiti and Chile with my girlfriend for the past 4 months. I have posted pictures of the trip in the Travel section.</li>
  <li>Sports: Hiking in Switzerland, running on the beach in Britanny, practicing Fitness/Crossfit. I used to play volleyball and have been Swiss national champion in Junior. I also used to (and still do sometimes) practice javelin. I won several times the Javelin Championship in RhÃ´ne-Alpes region in Junior (Â± 50 meters).</li>
  <li>Animals: I have been vegetarian for close to 4 years, love animals and support several associations.</li>
  <li>Reading/Learning: I spend most of my free time trying to learn stuffs. I try to do 1 online course per month, although I donâ€™t always manage to do so.</li>
  <li>Entrepreneurship: I launched a first startup project during my Master and got some money from an entrepreneurial contest in Lausanne. I was invited at the 2018 final of this contest to share my experience on stage. I won a hackathon in 2019, but did not convert it to a proper project.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a B.Sc. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Actuarial Science both from the University of Lausanne (HEC Faculty). I donâ€™t expect many people to know what actuarial science is, but to keep it short, itâ€™s mostly applied mathematics and statistics for the insurance sector. I worked for 6 months in an insurance company, developed a large interest in Machine Learning and programming, and joined Telecom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France) for a Specialized Master in Data Science. I finished this degree in 2019. I am now a Ph.D. student in Speech Processing at EPFLâ€™s Idiap Lab (start March 2020).</p>

<p>I did an internship as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://anasen.com/">Anasen</a>, a Y-Combinator startup in Paris. I previously interned at <a href="https://veamly.com/">Veamly</a> in NLP. Outside of that, Iâ€™m a Machine Learning instructor at <a href="https://vivadata.org/">VivaData</a>, an AI Bootcamp in Paris, <a href="https://www.stat4decision.com/en/">Stat4Decision</a> and <a href="https://dit.sn/">Dakar Insitute of Technology</a>. I also write articles about AI for <a href="https://www.digitalminds.io/">Digital Minds</a>, <a href="https://www.explorium.ai/">Explorium</a>, <a href="https://www.stat4decision.com/en/">Stat4Decision</a> and on <a href="https://medium.com/@mael.fabien">Medium</a>. My technical interests are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning</li>
  <li>Statistics in general</li>
  <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
  <li>Speech Processing</li>
  <li>A bit of data engineering, since Iâ€™d like my next professional experience to be as a Machine Learning Engineering</li>
</ul>

<p>I started this blog in September 2018 for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing helps me understand. Pictures and schemas too. I am trying to combine both in my articles.</li>
  <li>I did most of my studies in English, although itâ€™s not my native language. This blog is a way to keep writing.</li>
  <li>Data Science is moving fast. Reading about AI-related news could be a full-time job. I learn best by doing projects. So I post most of them here.</li>
  <li>I forget stuff, so itâ€™s always good to have them written down in a single place.</li>
  <li>If this blog can help someone else, this really makes my day.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="mailto:mael.fabien@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you think we could work together on an article or a project, or if you have any question/remark. If you would like to get to know more about me and my projects, feel free to check out my <a href="https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/files/CV_MF.pdf">resume</a>. Iâ€™m uploading articles that Iâ€™m writing in my free time. Iâ€™m trying to upload one article per week on average.</p>

<p>I recently launched a newsletter in which I gather some articles I wrote on a topic, interesting Github repositories, projects, papers and more! If you want to stay in the loop, Iâ€™ll try to send 1 email per month :)</p>
