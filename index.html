<p> 
I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at the University of Vermont advised by Joe Near. I am also a research scientist at OpenMined. 
My research interests revolve around Data Privacy and all aspects of Machine Learning: theory, algorithms, and applications. 
Currently, I focus on provable fairness and privacy-preserving machine learning including differential privacy, federated learning, and multiparty computation. 
In the past, I worked on Computer Vision applications, specifically, deep learning for medical imaging and generative models. <p>

<!-- <h1> Hello </h1>

<p>Welcome to my blog. My name is Ivoline but you can call me Ivy. I am a Masters student in Computer Engineering at Konya Technical University. I am particularly interested in applying my experiences toward the discovery of new methods and trends that will improve state-of-the-art AI.
My technical interest are: <p>

  <ul>
    <li>Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning</li>
    <li>Computer Vision</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
    <li>Privacy Preserving AI</li>
    <li>Statistics and Data Engineering</li>
  </ul>


<p> As someone who believes in the power of AI for good,I have worked as a Junior ML Engineer in <a href="https://omdena.com/">Omdena</a>
  I also serve as a consultant for the
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> learning platform on a part time basis, where I utilize my specialized knowledge in the fields of
  Computer Vision, Android and Java Development to provide mentorship, project reviews and other student support services.</p>

<p>My research interests are an intersection of machine learning and deep learning for computer vision, natural language processing and privacy preserving AI. Outside of this, I write articles on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com//">Towards Data Science</a>.
I am exploring solutions for security and privacy for machine learning and AI ethics such as algorithmic bias and fairness.</p>

<p> Not only is this blog a way to share my AI journey with the world, it is also going to help me organize everything I learn and
  synthesize my own ideas.  As a mentor, I have had to answer the same questions multiple times to several mentees which was fun
  but also time consuming. My blog therefore doubles as a time saver. And most importantly, I hope someone somewhere gets to learn a thing or two.</p>

<p>I am a big believer in increasing the number of women in tech by showing girls and women that STEM is not a boys only club.</p>

 <p> When I am not building software, reading articles or mentoring, you can find me traveling, watching movies, reading, listening to music or cooking.</p>

<p><b> Now, you get to see my world, through the lens of Artificial Intelligencev.<b></p>
